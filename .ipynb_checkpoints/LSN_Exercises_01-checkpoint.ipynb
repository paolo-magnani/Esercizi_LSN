    "1. you should create code that is correct, simple, well organized, indented, commented, which uses self-explanatory names for variables and that is numerically efficient.\n",
    "2. I expect a responsible interaction during the exercises: the questions should be more related to the conduction of the exercises and to the meaning of the results obtained than to the computational problems. Bugs are usual in coding; for this reason, sooner or later, one should learn to deal with them by oneself ... if you'll be able to, it will be your main achievement in this Laboratory!\n",
